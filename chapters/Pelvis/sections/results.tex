\section{Results}
\label{sec:analysis}

The detailed accuracy and agreement results are presented in Table \ref{pelvis:resultsperrgait} and Figure \ref{blandaltman}. The pelvis roll angle in a stride (average of all strides of subjects) has been plotted in Figures \ref{fig:walk} and \ref{fig:trot} for both methods and both measurement devices. 

The results demonstrate a high level of accuracy of \gls{imu} for measuring pelvis roll angle. However, the agreement between the methods was low, for both of the measurement devices. During the walk, the pelvis roll angle calculation accuracy of a single \gls{imu} on the sacrum was 0.33 degrees compared to the rigid triad of markers. In the case of two \gls{imu}s on the tuber coxae, the accuracy was slightly higher resulting at 0.28 degrees when compared to the tuber coxae markers. 

The \gls{rmse} between methods using \gls{imu} was 2.09 degrees. However, this figure reduced to 1.57 degrees when employing the marker-based method. In addition, the accuracy of \gls{imu} on each method during trot was 0.67 degrees for single \gls{imu} calculation and 0.43 degrees for double \gls{imu} calculation. Using \gls{imu} as the measuring device, we achieved 3.59 degrees \gls{rmse} between methods while we calculated 3.55 degrees by using markers.
