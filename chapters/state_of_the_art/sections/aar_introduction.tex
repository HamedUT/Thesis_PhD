\section{Introduction}


The gait of sport horses is a rich source of information that not only provides insights into their performance but also their health and well-being.

\subsection{Chapter Organization}

The rest of the chapter is organized as follows.
In the following section we first discuss the aforementioned steps in the \gls{aar} pipeline in more detail and explain how these have been approached in the state of the art.
Subsequently, we survey and compare various \gls{aar} studies in. 

Typically, evaluating the sport performance from gait requires three steps. Gait data acquisition, calculation of performance-related parameters from the data, and assessment of performance from the calculated parameters.
