For left lead canter,  right hind hoof, right front hoof and left hind hoof simultaneously, left front hoof. \\

TÃ¶lt  & Natural  & A four-beat gait, hooves strike the ground in a specific sequence: right hind, right front, left hind, left front.

It lacks a suspension phase, distinguishing it from the trot, and can be performed at various speeds. \\
