 \textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Definition} \\
\midrule
Stride & The complete sequence of motion from the moment one of the hooves leaves the ground (hoof-off) until that same hoof makes contact with the ground again (hoof-on)\\
Stride duration & The time interval for a stride to occur \\
Stance duration & The time interval during which a limb is on the ground between the limb's hoof-on and hoof-off within a single stride\\
Swing duration &  The time interval during which a limb is in the air between the limb's hoof-off and hoof-on within a single stride\\
Stride frequency & The number of strides in a given unit of time, typically expressed as strides per second\\
Stride length & The distance covered during a stride\\
