\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this study, we achieved a novel outcome on one of the essential aspects of equine gait: developing a machine-learning model using gait parameters to label whether a horse is being ridden or not. We concluded that our model accurately identifies if the horse is being ridden by equipping the limb with a single inertial sensor. Together with other labeling models (e.g., speed estimation, event detection), the models from this study can be used to eliminate cumbersome labeling processes and pave the way for health and performance monitoring applications to be designed for automated and real-time analysis.
