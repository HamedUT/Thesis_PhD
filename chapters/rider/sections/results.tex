\section{Results}

18400 windows were extracted from the data, which resulted in more than 36000 strides. A total of 11,900 windows were labeled, with 7,450 and 4,450 labeled as "ridden" during walk and trot, respectively, while the remaining 3,550 and 2,950 were labeled as "not-ridden" during walk and trot. 

The best and the worst performing models were based on random forest and \gls{svm}, respectively. The performance results of the random forest models per gait were presented in detail in Table \ref{tab:rider_results}, and were compared with other algorithms in Table \ref{tab:rider_compared} (models trained based on sacrum+limb \gls{imu}s and walk+trot gait). For visual comparison, the accuracy results of the random forest models per gait are demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:rider_three} and compared with other machine learning models in Figure \ref{fig:rider_four}. Furthermore, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the models resulting from testing on walk+trot data are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:rider_five}.

It can be inferred from Table \ref{tab:rider_results} that the model based on Sacrum+Limb \gls{imu}s features yielded the best performance during walk, trot, and Walk+Trot. Between the two other models based on one \gls{imu}, the model based on limb \gls{imu} features performed better than the model based on sacrum \gls{imu} except for the specificity of walking data. Moreover, the performance of the models when using trotting data was slightly higher than walking data.

Using the weights from the output of \gls{nca}, the top ten features were selected and reported in Table \ref{tab:rider_features_results}. In addition, normalized values of the top three features between the two classes were demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:rider_six}. For model performance comparison based on the number of features, we reported the performance of the models based on the top ten features in Table \ref{tab:rider_features_results}, where five and four features were extracted from limb and sacrum \gls{imu}s, respectively. Out of all the parameters, only one was kinematic, the ninth feature, which represented swing duration. Half of the selected features were directly extracted from the \gls{imu}s raw signals (acceleration and angular velocity). The remaining were calculated from the integration of the raw signals (angle and displacement).
