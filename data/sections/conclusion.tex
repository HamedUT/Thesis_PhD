\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Within this chapter, we explained the data collection procedure. The collected dataset is a repository comprising data from sport horses, offering an opportunity to study their fitness capabilities and the characteristics related to their performance, all with an emphasis on the variances across different equine breeds and disciplines. This dataset stands out as the very first dataset that includes not only motion data but also physiological insights, recorded from multiple \gls{imu}s, \gls{hr} monitors, and blood samples. This dataset was gathered from eighty-eight sport horses performing state-of-the-art \gls{set} exercises and can be a valuable resource for research in equine fitness and the relationship between biomechanical and physiological aspects.
