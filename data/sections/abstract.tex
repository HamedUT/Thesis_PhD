The accurate assessment of equine locomotion and fitness plays a pivotal role in understanding the fitness and enhancing the performance of sport horses. This chapter presents a detailed account of the data collection process employed in this research project, focusing specifically on the utilization of \gls{imu} to assess the fitness of sport horses. By capturing precise and real-time measurements of acceleration, orientation, and angular velocity, \gls{imu}s provide valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of locomotion. The integration of \gls{imu} technology with the evaluation of fitness parameters offers a novel approach to enhancing our knowledge of equine athletic fitness and improving the overall well-being of sport horses.
